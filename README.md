Grammarly's Yahoo Answers Formality Corpus (GYAFC)
Dear Sir or Madam, May I introduce the GYAFC Corpus: Corpus, Benchmarks and Metrics for Formality Style Transfer
Sudha Rao (raosudha@cs.umd.edu) and Joel Tetreault (joel.tetreault@grammarly.com)
To appear in the proceedings of The 2018 North American Association of Computational Lingusitics (NAACL 2018)

The GYAFC corpus was created using the Yahoo Answers corpus: L6 - Yahoo! Answers Comprehensive Questions and Answers version 1.0. This Yahoo Answers corpus can be requested free of charge for research purposes. Access to our YAFC dataset will require users to first gain access to this Yahoo Answers corpus.

Once you have gained access to the L6 corpus, please forward the acknowledgment to Joel Tetreault (joel.tetreault@grammarly.com) and we will give you access to our YAFC corpus. Please let us know if you have any questions.
